[7/17/2018 10:11:44 AM] Pritpal Singh: You can build this code on latest Android Studio 3.2 but that may take some time to setup

[7/17/2018 10:12:14 AM] Miguel Cabeza: If its a big enhacement I will for sure contact you. I'm a developer myself but having developed in around 8 years, so I want to get closer to coding again so I'm curious to setup a dev env for Android and ust play wih it a bit :)

[7/17/2018 10:12:36 AM] Pritpal Singh: Great

[7/17/2018 10:12:38 AM] Miguel Cabeza: thanks for the info

[7/17/2018 10:12:38 AM] Pritpal Singh: :)

[7/17/2018 10:12:58 AM] Miguel Cabeza: you suggest better Android 2.23 instead of Android 3.2?

[7/17/2018 10:13:50 AM] Pritpal Singh: Yes, because when we started Gitreader 2.23 was latest that time so we have completed the project in that version only.

[7/17/2018 10:14:17 AM] Pritpal Singh: If you want then you can migrate to 3.2, not a big deal
